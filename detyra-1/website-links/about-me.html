        <span style="font-size: 28px;">Hi,</span> 
        I am Ensar Veseli.
        <br>
        I am a 15 year old ambitious boy who wants to learn about programming and about computers.
        <br>
        I always found computers very interesting. The way they worked always amazed me.
        <br>
        I always thought that computers helped us to do our everyday tasks.
        <br>
        It's amazing what people have built!
        <br>
        One day, I wish to be from the people that built something big, something that would change the lives
        of people for better.
    </p>
